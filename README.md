# QIA2023 Challenge

This repo contains the code for QIA2023 Challenge.
For more info, please refer to the report attached :)

> When you run the code,  please change the PATHS written in the code! Also note that the data is not public :(

### 1. Phase 1
Phase 1 consists of one single file `run.ipynb`  Following the comments, you can see which part of the code refers to the *training* and *testing.* Running all cells will give you the `csv` file needed.


### 2. Phase 2
Phase 2 consists of  two files. `train.py` and `test.py` After running `train.py`, you will get 4 json files, where each json file stores for the test set prediction by the best model of each dimension of MBTI. Then with these 4 files, run `test.py` to get the `csv` file needed.

Other .ipynbs (`chatgpt.ipynb`, `lgbm.ipynb`) include some of the other methods used for phase 2 prediction.
